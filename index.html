        <p>South African with a passion for travelling & coding.Since graduating from University I have lived in Spain,
            the United Kingdom and in the United Arab Emirates. The majority of my professional working career was spent
            in Dubai working as an HR Coordinator and Admin Supervisor for an international Heathcare company. I decided
            to return to South Africa in March 2020 where I started a remote 4 month SEO internship with a Dutch company
            in an attempt to keep myself busy during lockdown and learn a new skill. Once the world started returning to
            a new normal I found a job as a recruiter but the internship had a awakened a curiosity in me to follow a
            career in tech.
            I am now currently enrolled as a Web Dev student at HyperionDev where I am learning both <strong> front-end
                and
                back-end development.</strong>
